# Microservices Project (No scalable, only pattern learning purposes)

Welcome to the Microservices Project! This project is organized into microservices to achieve scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
```
project-root/
├── microservices/
│ ├── services/
│ │ ├── service1/
│ │ │ ├── ...
│ │ ├── service2/
│ │ │ ├── ...
│ │ ├── service3/
│ │ │ ├── ...
│ │ └── ...
│ ├── shared/
│ │ ├── ...
│ ├── config/
│ │ ├── ...
│ ├── infrastructure/
│ │ ├── ...
│ ├── app.js
│ ├── server.js
│ ├── package.json
│ └── .gitignore
├── docker-compose.yml
└── ...
```

- The `microservices` directory contains individual microservices, each with its own folder for code, configurations, models, routes, and more.
- The `shared` directory contains shared utility code and common resources.
- The `config` directory holds configuration files for different services and environments.
- The `infrastructure` directory contains scripts, database migrations, and deployment-related resources.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `microservices/services/service1` directory (replace `service1` with the desired microservice).
3. Customize the microservice's code, configurations, and other files as needed.
4. In the root directory, run `docker-compose up` to start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## CI/CD and Automation

- Implement CI/CD workflows for each microservice to automate building, testing, and deployment.
- Use tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions to streamline the development and deployment process.

## Kubernetes (Optional)

- Consider migrating to Kubernetes for advanced orchestration and scalability.
- Create Kubernetes manifests for each microservice and deploy resources in a Kubernetes cluster.
